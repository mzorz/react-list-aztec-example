## RN RecyclerView list and Aztec integration demo project

## Android: Run the example app

Make sure to have an emulator running or an Android device connected, and then:

```
$ yarn clean:install
$ yarn start --reset-cache

$ yarn android #DO THIS ON ANOTHER SHELL WINDOW
```

This will build the Android library (via `gradle`) and example app, then launch the main example activity on your connected device and run the Metro bundler at the same time.
